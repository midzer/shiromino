; Individual audio file volume configuration

; Values go from 0.0 to 100.0. 100.0 on a sound effect file will mean it plays
; at whatever your SFX_VOLUME is set to, same with music tracks and MUSIC_VOLUME.
; You can use values such as "0" or "100", without the decimal point.

; This is mainly intended as a way to balance different tracks and effects
; compared to each other when supplying custom audio files.

; This INI is case sensitive, to ensure the right filenames are matched to
; their volumes on filesystems that are case sensitive. Though, unavoidably, on
; case insensitive filesystems, filenames with characters not matching the case
; of the real filenames will still work.
