<a href="https://github.com/shiromino/shiromino/actions" rel="Build status">![build](https://github.com/shiromino/shiromino/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master)</a>

shiromino is a portable, free and open-source puzzle game made possible by a small team of volunteers. Unlike many other games of its kind, shiromino doesn't stop at [tetrominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino), but also lets you experience your favorite arcade titles with [pentominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino).
