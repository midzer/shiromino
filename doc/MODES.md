# Reference for implemented game modes
## Pentomino C (revision 1.5)
Pentomino C is an original game mode which introduces the 18 pentomino pieces in addition to the 7 tetrominoes, for a total of 25 pieces. It uses a complex and delicately balanced randomizer function to ensure that pieces are dealt to the player with a distribution that is predictable and gentle enough to feel fair.
### Levels
Pentomino C ends at level 1200. At level 1000 there is a timer-stop: if the player reaches level 1000 with greater than 10 minutes on the timer, the game abruptly ends. From level 1000 onward, the game speeds up, and begins dealing out significantly less friendly piece distributions, which become exponentially more difficult until level 1160 where the difficulty maxes out until the end of the game.
### Grade System
The grading in Pentomino C is entirely score-based. The scores required for each grade are as follows:
- Grade 8: 1,000pts
- Grade 7: 1,400pts
- Grade 6: 2,000pts
- Grade 5: 3,000pts
- Grade 4: 5,000pts
- Grade 3: 8,000pts
- Grade 2: 13,000pts
- Grade 1: 19,000pts
- Grade S1: 26,000pts
- Grade S2: 33,000pts
- Grade S3: 41,000pts
- Grade S4: 50,000pts
- Grade S5: 60,000pts
- Grade S6: 72,000pts
- Grade S7: 87,000pts
- Grade S8: 114,000pts
- Grade S9: 132,000pts

At levels 500 and 1000, there are grade and time requirements which, if passed, grant the player access to the grades of M (Master) and GM (Grand Master).
### Requirements for M and GM
- At level 500: Grade S4 and time <= 5:30
- At level 1000: Grade S9 and time <= 10:00 (M awarded)
- At level 1200: Survive (GM awarded)
